A. 0, 8, 0, 8
B. 16
C. up->e2.x = *(up->e2.next->e1.p) - up->e2.next->e1.y;

A. yes, x and dx will be rounded the same way 

B. no, if x = 0  and y = Tmin, double(x-y) will result in overflow

C. yes, even if there was rounding, since it's all addition it won't have an effect no matter the order

D. no, if dx and dy very large numbers like Tmax with dz a smaller number, overflow will make the two yield different answers

E. no, if dx = 0 dx/dx will have an undefined value
